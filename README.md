# SausageAdapter

This is the Shetckup-3D model of the sausage filler 
adapter for Kitchen Aid (r).

The currently sausage filler kit that's available (5KSMSSA)
works only with 5KSMFGA grinder.

If you have the older version of the grinder (FGA2), you won't
be able to fit it. You can use the model in this repo instead
of the one in the SSA kit.
